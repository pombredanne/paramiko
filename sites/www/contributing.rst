How to get the code
===================

Our primary Git repository is on Github at `paramiko/paramiko
<https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko>`_; please follow their instructions for
cloning to your local system. (If you intend to submit patches/pull requests,
we recommend forking first, then cloning your fork. Github has excellent
documentation for all this.)


How to submit bug reports or new code
=====================================

Please see `this project-agnostic contribution guide
<http://contribution-guide.org>`_ - we follow it explicitly.
