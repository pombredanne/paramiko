* :release:`1.12.2 <2014-02-14>`
* :release:`1.11.4 <2014-02-14>`
* :release:`1.10.6 <2014-02-14>`
* :feature:`58` Allow client code to access the stored SSH server banner via

  ``@Jhoanor`` for the patch.
* :bug:`252` (`Fabric #1020 <https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/1020>`_)
  Enhanced the implementation of ``ProxyCommand`` to avoid a deadlock/hang
  condition that frequently occurs at ``Transport`` shutdown time. Thanks to
  Mateusz Kobos, Matthijs van der Vleuten and Guillaume Zitta for the original
  reports and to Marius Gedminas for helping test nontrivial use cases.
* :bug:`268` Fix some missed renames of ``ProxyCommand`` related error classes.
  Thanks to Marius Gedminas for catch & patch.
* :bug:`34` (PR :issue:`35`) Fix SFTP prefetching incompatibility with some
  SFTP servers regarding request/response ordering. Thanks to Richard
  Kettlewell.
* :bug:`193` (and its attentant PRs :issue:`230` & :issue:`253`) Fix SSH agent
  problems present on Windows. Thanks to David Hobbs for initial report and to
  Aarni Koskela & Olle Lundberg for the patches.
* :release:`1.12.1 <2014-01-08>`
* :release:`1.11.3 <2014-01-08>`
* :release:`1.10.5 <2014-01-08>`
* :bug:`225 (1.12+)` Note ecdsa requirement in README. Thanks to Amaury
  Rodriguez for the catch.
* :bug:`176` Fix AttributeError bugs in known_hosts file (re)loading. Thanks
  to Nathan Scowcroft for the patch & Martin Blumenstingl for the initial test
  case.
* :release:`1.12.0 <2013-09-27>`
* :release:`1.11.2 <2013-09-27>`
* :release:`1.10.4 <2013-09-27>`
* :feature:`152` Add tentative support for ECDSA keys. **This adds the ecdsa
  module as a new dependency of Paramiko.** The module is available at
  `warner/python-ecdsa on Github <https://github.com/warner/python-ecdsa>`_ and
  `ecdsa on PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ecdsa>`_.

    * Note that you might still run into problems with key negotiation --
      Paramiko picks the first key that the server offers, which might not be
      what you have in your known_hosts file.
    * Mega thanks to Ethan Glasser-Camp for the patch.

* :feature:`136` Add server-side support for the SSH protocol's 'env' command.
  Thanks to Benjamin Pollack for the patch.
* :bug:`156 (1.11+)` Fix potential deadlock condition when using Channel
  objects as sockets (e.g. when using SSH gatewaying). Thanks to Steven Noonan
  and Frank Arnold for catch & patch.
* :bug:`179` Fix a missing variable causing errors when an ssh_config file has
  a non-default AddressFamily set. Thanks to Ed Marshall & Tomaz Muraus for
  catch & patch.
* :bug:`200` Fix an exception-causing typo in ``demo_simple.py``. Thanks to Alex
  Buchanan for catch & Dave Foster for patch.
* :bug:`199` Typo fix in the license header cross-project. Thanks to Armin
  Ronacher for catch & patch.
* :release:`1.11.1 <2013-09-20>`
* :release:`1.10.3 <2013-09-20>`
* :bug:`162` Clean up HMAC module import to avoid deadlocks in certain uses of
  SSHClient. Thanks to Gernot Hillier for the catch & suggested fix.
* :bug:`36` Fix the port-forwarding demo to avoid file descriptor errors.
  Thanks to Jonathan Halcrow for catch & patch.
* :bug:`168` Update config handling to properly handle multiple 'localforward'
  and 'remoteforward' keys. Thanks to Emre Yılmaz for the patch.
* :release:`1.11.0 <2013-07-26>`
* :release:`1.10.2 <2013-07-26>`
* :bug:`98 major` On Windows, when interacting with the PuTTY PAgeant, Paramiko
  now creates the shared memory map with explicit Security Attributes of the
  user, which is the same technique employed by the canonical PuTTY library to
  avoid permissions issues when Paramiko is running under a different UAC
  context than the PuTTY Ageant process. Thanks to Jason R. Coombs for the
  patch.
* :support:`100` Remove use of PyWin32 in ``win_pageant`` module. Module was
  already dependent on ctypes for constructing appropriate structures and had
  ctypes implementations of all functionality. Thanks to Jason R. Coombs for
  the patch.
* :bug:`87 major` Ensure updates to ``known_hosts`` files account for any
  updates to said files after Paramiko initially read them. (Includes related
  fix to guard against duplicate entries during subsequent ``known_hosts``
  loads.) Thanks to ``@sunweaver`` for the contribution.
* :bug:`153` (also :issue:`67`) Warn on parse failure when reading known_hosts
  file.  Thanks to ``@glasserc`` for patch.
* :bug:`146` Indentation fixes for readability. Thanks to Abhinav Upadhyay for
  catch & patch.
* :release:`1.10.1 <2013-04-05>`
* :bug:`142` (`Fabric #811 <https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/811>`_)
  SFTP put of empty file will still return the attributes of the put file.
  Thanks to Jason R. Coombs for the patch.
* :bug:`154` (`Fabric #876 <https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/876>`_)
  Forwarded SSH agent connections left stale local pipes lying around, which
  could cause local (and sometimes remote or network) resource starvation when
  running many agent-using remote commands. Thanks to Kevin Tegtmeier for catch
  & patch.
* :release:`1.10.0 <2013-03-01>`
* :feature:`66` Batch SFTP writes to help speed up file transfers. Thanks to
  Olle Lundberg for the patch.
* :bug:`133 major` Fix handling of window-change events to be on-spec and not
  attempt to wait for a response from the remote sshd; this fixes problems with
  less common targets such as some Cisco devices. Thanks to Phillip Heller for
  catch & patch.
* :feature:`93` Overhaul SSH config parsing to be in line with ``man
  ssh_config`` (& the behavior of ``ssh`` itself), including addition of parameter
  expansion within config values. Thanks to Olle Lundberg for the patch.
* :feature:`110` Honor SSH config ``AddressFamily`` setting when looking up
  local host's FQDN. Thanks to John Hensley for the patch.
* :feature:`128` Defer FQDN resolution until needed, when parsing SSH config
  files.  Thanks to Parantapa Bhattacharya for catch & patch.
* :bug:`102 major` Forego random padding for packets when running under
  ``*-ctr`` ciphers.  This corrects some slowdowns on platforms where random
  byte generation is inefficient (e.g. Windows). Thanks to  ``@warthog618`` for
  catch & patch, and Michael van der Kolff for code/technique review.
* :feature:`127` Turn ``SFTPFile`` into a context manager. Thanks to Michael
  Williamson for the patch.
* :feature:`116` Limit ``Message.get_bytes`` to an upper bound of 1MB to protect
  against potential DoS vectors. Thanks to ``@mvschaik`` for catch & patch.
* :feature:`115` Add convenience ``get_pty`` kwarg to ``Client.exec_command`` so
  users not manually controlling a channel object can still toggle PTY
  creation. Thanks to Michael van der Kolff for the patch.
* :feature:`71` Add ``SFTPClient.putfo`` and ``.getfo`` methods to allow direct
  uploading/downloading of file-like objects. Thanks to Eric Buehl for the
  patch.
* :feature:`113` Add ``timeout`` parameter to ``SSHClient.exec_command`` for
  easier setting of the command's internal channel object's timeout. Thanks to
  Cernov Vladimir for the patch.
* :support:`94` Remove duplication of SSH port constant. Thanks to Olle
  Lundberg for the catch.
* :feature:`80` Expose the internal "is closed" property of the file transfer
  class ``BufferedFile`` as ``.closed``, better conforming to Python's file
  interface.  Thanks to ``@smunaut`` and James Hiscock for catch & patch.
